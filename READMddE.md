# Shiksha-Mitra

Shiksha-Mitra is a digital platform for personal growth and mutual accountability, inspired by the ancient Vedic concept of "Shiksha-Mitra" where learners shared responsibilities to develop empathy, discipline, and teamwork. In today's hyper-individualized world, Shiksha-Mitra connects you with a real person — your Mitra — to journey through life's challenges together.

- **Accountability**: Mutual commitment to goals and progress
- **Emotional Safety**: Compassionate support during difficult times
- **Personal Evolution**: Holistic development of character and resilience

### Key Features

Your Mitra relationship goes beyond casual friendship — it's about consistent growth through:
- **Daily Check-ins**: Share your day and receive encouragement
- **Goal Setting**: Set shared objectives and track progress together
- **Mutual Support**: Be there for each other during challenges and celebrations
- **Accountability Partnerships**: Gentle reminders and motivation when needed
- **Cultural Connection**: Bridge geographical and cultural gaps through shared human experiences

## Architecture & Technology

This project consists of a modern React-based application built with:

### Frontend Stack
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite 5** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **React Router DOM** for client-side routing
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography
- **ESLint** + TypeScript-ESLint for code quality

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root (copy from `.env.example`):

```env
# Required API Keys for various AI providers
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key_here
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your_perplexity_api_key_here
# ... other optional keys
```

## Deployment

The application can be deployed to any static hosting service:

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build
```

This creates a `dist/` directory with optimized static files suitable for:
- Netlify
- Vercel
- GitHub Pages
- Cloudflare Pages
- AWS S3 + CloudFront

### SPA Routing Setup
When deploying, ensure your hosting provider serves `index.html` for all routes to support client-side routing.
